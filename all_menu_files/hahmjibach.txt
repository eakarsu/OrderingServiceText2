Dak-bokkeum-tang
(Korean: 닭볶음탕), dak-dori-tang (닭도리탕), or braised spicy chicken is a traditional Korean dish made by boiling chunks of chicken with vegetables and spices.[1] The ingredients are sometimes stir-fried before being boiled.[2] It is a jjim or jorim-like dish, and the recipe varies across the Korean peninsula. Common ingredients include potatoes, carrots, green and red chili peppers, dried red chili peppers, scallions, onions, garlic, ginger, gochujang (chili paste), gochutgaru (chili powder), soy sauce, and sesame oil.[3]
Etymology debate: Some groups advocating linguistic purism in Korean argue against the use of the term dak-dori-tang (닭도리탕) due to the perception that it is a Japanese-Korean hybrid, though the etymology of the middle word dori (도리) is not definitively known. In South Korea, the National Institute of the Korean Language claims that the word came from Japanese tori (鳥; "bird"), and suggests that the word should be refined into dak-bokkeum-tang (닭볶음탕).[4] However, the status of dori as a loanword has been subject to debate. This is because the institute has not presented the grounds for the argument besides the phonetic similarity of dori to the Japanese word tori.[5] The word dori-tang appears in Haedong jukji, a 1925 collection of poems by the Joseon literatus Choe Yeongnyeon. In the book, Chinese characters do (桃) ri (李) tang (湯) were used to transliterate the Korean dish name.[6] A food columnist argued that, had the word been Japanese, the character jo (鳥; pronounced tori in Japanese) would have been used instead of the hanja transliteration of the Korean pronunciation.[7] Alternative theories on the origin of dori include the assertions that it came from dyori (됴리), the archaic form of Sino-Korean word jori (조리; 調理; "to cook"), and that it came from the native Korean verb dorida (도리다; "to cut out").[8] None of the theories mentioned before has been widely accepted as the established etymology.

Jeongol (Korean: 전골) is a Korean-style hot pot made by putting meat, mushroom, seafood, seasoning, etc., in a stew pot, adding broth, and boiling it.[1] It is similar to the category of Korean stews called jjigae, with the main difference being that jjigae are generally made with only a single main ingredient, and named after that ingredient (such as kimchi jjigae or sundubu jjigae), while jeongol usually contain a variety of main ingredients.[2] An additional difference is that jeongol (like gujeolpan) was originally a dish for upper-class Koreans and members of the royal court, while jjigae was a simpler dish for commoners.[3]
History: According to the late Joseon era book Manguksamulkiwon Yeoksa (만국사물기원역사; 萬國事物紀原歷史; lit. The History of Various Objects From Around the World), jeongol originated from ancient times when soldiers would cook their food in iron helmets during times of war for lack of cooking utensils.[4][2][5] In other Joseon era documents such as Kyeongdo Jabji (경도잡지; 京都雜志), it is mentioned that jeongol was cooked in a vessel called jeolliptu (전립투; lit. soldier's hat) because it resembled a soldier's helmet. In Siuijeonseo, it is mentioned that thinly sliced seasoned beef was cooked in a pot and sprinkled with pine nut powder, and occasionally cooked with bamboo shoots, baby octopus and oysters.[2]
Preparation: Jeongol usually contains sliced beef or seafood, vegetables, mushrooms, and other seasonings, which are boiled with a small amount of broth in a jeongolteul (전골틀, pot used for cooking jeongol). They may also include mandu (dumplings). Some jeongol are spicy, containing added gochujang or chili pepper powder, although these ingredients may be omitted. The variety of broth used varies according to the type of jeongol being prepared.[2]

Gejang (Korean: 게장) or gejeot (게젓) is a variety of jeotgal, or salted fermented seafood in Korean cuisine, which is made by marinating fresh raw crabs in either ganjang (soy sauce) or a chili pepper powder based sauce. The term consists of the two words; ge, meaning "a crab", and jang which means "condiment" in Korean.[1] The crabs selected for the Gejang dish are mainly female crabs with eggs.
While gejang was originally used to refer to crabs marinated in soy sauce, it is now also called ganjang-gejang (Korean: 간장게장) to differentiate it from yangnyeom-gejang (양념게장). The latter is a relatively new dish that emerged alongside the boom in South Korea's restaurant industry. Its origins appear to come from the Chungcheong and Jeolla provinces, which both have long-standing traditions of mixing raw fish or dried pollock with a spicy red pepper flake or gochujang sauce.[2] People later began preparing crab in a similar fashion, resulting in what is known today as yangnyeom-gejang.[2][3] "Yangnyeom" means "seasoning" or "seasoned" in Korean, and refers to the spicy sauce of the dish that is made with chili pepper powder.
Gyeongsang, Jeolla, and Jeju Island are famous for their own types of gejang.[4] It is a representative specialty of Yeosu in the South Jeolla Province, and a traditional Jeolla cuisine dish.[5] According to Korean traditional medicine, crabs possess a 'cold nature' that can cool one's body temperature, and so gejang is believed to be good for driving away the spring fever.
According to a poll of tourists to Korea, gejang is difficult to eat because the dish is too spicy and salty.[6]
Historical records: Historical records on gejang can be found in books such as Sallim gyeongje (lit. "Farm Management"),[7] Gyuhap chongseo (lit. "Women's Encyclopedia"),[8] Jubangmun (주방문, 酒方文, lit. "Book of Making Alcoholic beverage"), Siui jeonseo (lit. "Complete Collection of Corrections and Discussions"), and others written during the Joseon period of Korea (1392 - 1910). As a traditional Korean dish, is estimated to have been consumed on the Korean Peninsula since the 1600s. According to Sallim gyeongje which is written around the end of the 17th century, making gejang is referred to as "johaebeop" (조해법, 糟蟹法), which means "a way of marinating crabs in sediments of liquor". With this method, crabs are marinated in a mixture of jaegang (재강, sediments of liquor), salt, and an alcoholic beverage. Generally, gejang spoils if preserved for a long time; however, the gejang made using johaebeop can be eaten until the next spring. Additionally, the book records various ways of making gejang such as juhaebeop (酒蟹法, made with alcoholic beverage), chojang haebeop (醋醬蟹法, made with soy sauce and vinegar), and yeomtang haebeop (鹽湯蟹法, made with boiled salted water). It also records methods of crab rearing which are called Yukseon chibeop (肉膳治法). These records verify that the consumption of gejang in the Korean diet appeared as early as the 17th century.[4][9] Historical records such as the “Gyuhap Chongseo,” “Jubangmun,” and “Shinui Jeonseo” mention gejang. Crabs were easily accessible by simply stepping into the water, and even when food was scarce, households could make soy sauce, making gejang a common dish. At that time, it was referred to as salted crab.
The term “ganjang gejang” (soy sauce marinated crab) became popular in South Korea south of the 38th parallel after yangnyeom gejang (spicy marinated crab) gained popularity in the 1980s. There are two main types of gejang that became popular in South Korea from the 1990s, differentiated by their marinades: the soy sauce-based ganjang gejang (간장게장) and the spicy yangnyeom gejang (양념게장) made with a chili seasoning. Typically, these dishes are eaten raw without heating. They are often referred to as “rice thieves” (밥도둑) because they pair so well with rice. The most delicious blue crabs are considered to be those caught from December to June for females, and from July to October for males, although the timing can vary by species. Outside these periods, rapidly frozen crabs may be used. Gejang is served in seafood and barbecue restaurants across South Korea, and there are also specialized gejang restaurants. It is sold in department store delis and markets as well. According to the South Korean Ministry of Unification’s “Specialist Written Unification Food Recipe” on December 20, 2021, the Korean-style ganjang gejang popular in Japan does not exist in North Korea. Instead, North Korean gejang is characterized by the use of “dry soy sauce.” This unique North Korean ingredient is a solid form of soy sauce, which is not yet used in South Korean cuisine. North Korean gejang is not cooked, so it is best to use richly flavored brewed soy sauce to enhance its taste and aroma. Yangnyeom gejang is a seasoned crab dish, and as people began to refer to it as such, the existing gejang became known as ganjang gejang. The commercialization of ganjang gejang began when several Korean celebrities started businesses under their names. Notably, the entertainer Kim Soo-mi was involved.[10] As Korean celebrities promoted ganjang gejang, interest in the dish grew, leading to the establishment of ganjang gejang restaurants and increased consumption. In the 21st century, ganjang gejang has gained global popularity. It is particularly well-known in Japan, where it is highly recognized. The Japanese interest in ganjang gejang stems from the similarities in food culture, such as the use of soy sauce, rice, and seafood. Additionally, it was an unfamiliar type of food in Japan, and after the “Winter Sonata” boom, Japanese tourists visiting Korea often included ganjang gejang in their dining experiences. Consequently, some ganjang gejang restaurants in Seoul specifically target Japanese customers and offer services in Japanese. Since the 21st century, ganjang gejang has also become known in the United States and Western Europe, and it is now a common dish for visitors to Korea to try.[11][12]
Crabs and harvest: Gejang was originally made with freshwater crabs which have become scarce. As a result, gejang is now commonly made with kkotge (horse crab), caught in the Yellow Sea (West Sea) on the west side of the Korean peninsula. Among the most popular gejang made with freshwater crabs are, chamgejang of the North Gyeongsang Province, which can be preserved and eaten after a year, and beotteok gejang, which can be eaten immediately after preparation.[13]
Preparation: To prepare ganjang-gejang, crabs are first thoroughly cleaned using a brush while submerged in a bowl of water. They are then rinsed to remove moisture. Next, the crabs are put in a hangari (earthenware crock) and are salted for about six hours. To prepare the sauce, a mixture of ganjang is boiled briefly along with sesame oil, sugar, finely sliced scallions, minced garlic, ginger, and finely shredded fresh red chili pepper. Once the salted crabs are removed from the hangari and placed in a bowl, the hot sauce is poured onto the crabs. An hour later, the ganjang is removed from the bowl and reheated to reach its boiling point. It is again poured over the crabs. This procedure is repeated for a third and fourth time. The dish can be eaten once the sauce is chilled. If using boiled ganjang after it has been chilled, the gejang can be eaten two weeks after preparation, and can be preserved for even longer periods. A variation involves adding minced beef while the sauce is poured over the crabs, endowing the gejang with more spices.[1] In present times, some people may choose to add lemon, chili pepper, or traditional medicine when making gejang to remove its fishy smell and increase its rich flavor.[14]
As for yangnyeom gejang, the dish is made with raw crabs seasoned with a sweet and spicy sauce of chili pepper powder, ground Korean pear, onions, ginger, garlic, whole sesame seeds, and sesame oil. The gejang can be eaten half a day after it is prepared. It is also best to consume the dish within two or three days to keep its sweet, spicy, and sour taste intact. If the crabs are first marinated in a boiled and then chilled mixture of eakjeok (액젓, filtered jeotgal) and soy sauce before adding in the spicy sauce, the yangnyeom gejang can be well marinated with the latter sauce, and be preserved longer.[14]
