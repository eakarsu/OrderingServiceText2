our story
Old-world traditions meet modern innovations at Doner Point. We’ve recreated the authentic flavors of Turkish doner to Paterson, New Jersey, creating a unique dining experience previously only found in Turkiye.

"doner" also means "gyro" and "shawarma"

doner description
Our Doner is made in the traditional fashion: a perfect ratio of tender, juicy lamb and beef, marinated and seasoned for 48 hours, and cooked on a rotating spit in our kitchen. We then serve it over our hand-made bread with your choice of toppings, including fresh lettuce, tomatoes and onions.
We take great pride in our doner, and we’ve worked tirelessly to perfect our recipe. We think you’ll agree that we’ve brought the authentic taste of Turkish doner right here to Paterson, New Jersey.
